# IDH-classification-of-glioma-using-rotation-invariant-uniform-Local-Ternary-Pattern
IDH classification of glioma by analyzing textures derived using 2D rotation-invariant, uniform Local Ternary Pattern (LTP) method 

**Input specification:** Input the image contents as numpy arrays. Also input number of images that are retrieved in numpy arrays.

**Ouput specification:** Upper LTP and lower LTP images will be displayed in the output, that are obtained using 2D rotation-invariant, uniform local ternary pattern method.
